<h2>Hi! <img width=22 src="https://github.com/Anwarvic/Anwarvic/blob/master/assets/hi.gif?raw=true"></h2>

My name is "Mohamed Anwar", but you can call me "Anwar". I'm on the purge of starting
my PhD journey, so your well-wishes are greatly appreciated. My primary research
interest focuses on the <strong>Speech and Sound Processing</strong> domain,
with a specific interest in <strong>audio-visual speech processing</strong>.
Motivated by the Bimodal Perception of Speech in humans, I’m very driven to
contribute to the development of the next generation of speech-based models
capable of leveraging visual signals, such as facial expressions and body
language, to expand models’ capabilities.

In 2023, I was very fortunate to be part of the
[AI residency](https://ai.meta.com/join-us/residency-program/) program at Meta,
where I was advised by [Changhan Wang](https://www.changhan.me/) and Dr.
[Bowen Shi](https://home.ttic.edu/~bshi/).
I earned my [African Master's for Machine Intelligence (AMMI)](https://aimsammi.org/)
in 2022. My master's thesis was advised by Dr. [Julia Kreutzer](https://juliakreutzer.github.io/)
and [Melvin Johnson](https://research.google/people/melvin-johnson/) and it was
about code-switching in machine translation. Also, I interned at Naver Labs
Europe under the supervision on Prof.
[Laurent Besacier](https://europe.naverlabs.com/people_user_naverlabs/laurent-besacier/)
and [Inyoung Kim](https://europe.naverlabs.com/people_user_naverlabs/Inyoung-Kim).
Prior to my academic pursuit, I was an R&D software engineer at IST Networks
where I was one of the main contributors to [Nūn](https://www.istnetworks.com/nun-studio/),
an Arabic Text-to-Speech system, and [botter](https://botter.io/), a chatbot
with transferable skills.

Here is a selection of my research:
